          Historically there had been two types of computers:-
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Fixed Program Computers: <br>
            The functions are very specific and they couldn't be reprogrammed. Ex - Calculator</li>
            <li>Stored Program Computers: <br>
            These can be programmed to carries out many different task, applications are stored on them. <br>
            Modern computers arre based on source program concept introduced by John Von Nuemann.
          </li>
            
            <img id="img1" src="img/john_von.png" alt="John Von Nuemann"> 
          </ol>
          Central Proccessing Unit: <br>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Control Unit: </b> A control unit (C.U) handles all proccess control signals. It direct all input and output flows fetches code for instructions and control how data moves around the system.</li>
            <li><b>Arithematics Logic Unit: </b> The Arithematics Logic unit is that part of the C.P.U that handles all the calculations, the C.P.U mainly. <br> Ex -  Addition, Substraction, etc. <br>
            It performs logical operations such bitshifting operation, comparisions, etc.</li>
          </ol>
	<p><b>Computer memory:</b> Computer memory refers to a storage space in a computer system that is used to store data and instructions for processing.</p>

    <p><b>Here are some main types of memory:</b><br>
    1. <b>RAM</b><br>
    2. <b>ROM</b><br>
    3. <b>Cache</b><br>
    4. <b>Flash</b><br>
    5. <b>Solid-State Drive (SSD)</b></p>

    <p><b>Memory hierarchy:</b></p>

    <!-- Placeholder for image source -->
    <img id="img1" src="img/MemoryHierarchy.png" alt="Memory Hierarchy Image">

    <p><b>Random Access Memory (RAM):</b> RAM is volatile memory used by the computer to store data that allows access to the storage medium, and its contents are lost when the computer is powered off.</p>

    <p><b>Read-Only Memory (ROM):</b> ROM is non-volatile memory that retains its contents even when the computer is powered on. ROM is used to store essential system instructions, such as BIOS, which is essential for the computer.</p>

    <p><b>Cache Memory:</b> Cache memory is a small-sized type of volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to the processor and stores frequently used computer program applications and data.</p>

    <p><b>Flash Memory:</b> Flash memory is a type of non-volatile computer storage that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. It is commonly used in USB drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives (SSD).</p>

    <p><b>Hard Disk Drive:</b> A hard disk is a non-volatile storage drive that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using rapidly rotated disks coated with magnetic material.</p>

    <p><b>Solid-State Drive (SSD):</b> It is a type of non-volatile storage device that uses NAND-based flash memory to store data persistently.</p>

    <p><b>Input Devices:</b> Input devices are hardware components that allow users to interact with the computer system by providing data or commands.</p>

    <p><b>Output Devices:</b> Output devices are hardware components that present information or results generated by the computer to users.</p>

    <p><b>Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):</b> Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of a CPU, also known as computer architecture or machine language, defines the sets of instructions that a processor can execute.</p>

    <p><b>Here are some components of (ISA):</b><br>
    1. <b>Data Type</b><br>
    2. <b>Registers</b><br>
    3. <b>Addressing Modes</b><br>
    4. <b>Instruction Types</b><br>
    5. <b>Instruction Format</b><br>
    6. <b>Control Flow</b><br>
    7. <b>Interrupts and Exceptions</b><br>
    8. <b>I/O Instructions (Input/Output)</b></p>

		<p><b>1. Data type:</b> Data type specifies the types of data that the CPU can handle, such as integer, floating-point number, character, etc.</p>

    <p><b>2. Registers:</b> Registers define the set of registers that the CPU can use for temporary storage of data during computation.</p>

    <p><b>3. Addressing mode:</b> Addressing mode describes the various ways in which operands can be specified for the instructions.</p>

    <p><b>4. Instruction types:</b> Instruction types specify the categories of instructions supported by the CPU.</p>

    <p><b>5. Instruction format:</b> Instruction format defines the structure of machine instructions, including op (code operational code) and operand field.</p>

    <p><b>6. Control flow:</b> Control flow describes how the flow of control is managed in the program, including branch and jump instructions.</p>

    <p><b>7. Interrupts and exceptions:</b> Outline how the CPU responds to external events, errors, or exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution.</p>

    <p><b>Computer register:</b></p>

    <img src="img/80.jpg" alt="Computer Register Image" id="img1">


    <p>1. <b>OUTR (8-bit):</b> It holds the output character.</p>
    <p>2. <b>IMPR (8-bit):</b> It holds the input character.</p>
    <p>3. <b>PC (12-bit):</b> It is used to add the address of the next instruction to be executed.</p>
    <p>4. <b>AR (12-bit):</b> It is used to hold the address of the operand in memory.</p>
    <p>5. <b>DR (16-bit):</b> It holds the memory operands.</p>
    <p>6. <b>AC (16-bit):</b> It is the processor register that is used to hold the result of the current operation.</p>
    <p>7. <b>IR (16-bit):</b> It holds the instruction code.</p>
    <p>8. <b>TR (16-bit):</b> It is used to hold the temporary data value of the operation executed by the processor.</p>

    <p><b>Instruction cycle:</b></p>

    <p><b>IC = FC + EC:</b></p>
    <p><b>IC:</b> Instruction cycle</p>
    <p><b>FC:</b> Fetch cycle</p>
    <p><b>EC:</b> Execute cycle</p>
<img src="img/instruction_cycle.png" alt="Error" id="img1">

          
<img src="img/inscycle.png" alt="inscycle" id="img1">
    <h4>Instruction Cycle :-</h4>
    <p><strong>The total number of clock cycles required to execute an instruction is called the instruction cycle.</strong></p>
    <p>Instruction cycle contains two operations: fetch and execute.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Fetch Cycle:</strong> The total number of clock cycles required to fetch the operand or instruction cycle from memory is called the fetch cycle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Execute Cycle:</strong> The total number of clock cycles required to execute an instruction is called the execute cycle. IC = FC + EC</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Register Transfer Language (RTL)</h4>
    <p>The information transformed from one register to another register is represented in symbolic form by the replacement operator and is called Register Transfer.</p>

    <h4>Basic Symbols of RTL</h4>
    <img src="img/RTLsymbol.png" alt="RTLsymbol" id="img1">

    <h4>Register Transfer Operations</h4>
    <p>The operation performed on the data stored in the registers is referred to as register transfer operations.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Simple Transfer – R2 <- R1:</strong> The content of R1 is copied into R2 without affecting the content of R1. It is an unconditional type of transfer operation.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Conditional Transfer:</strong></p>
    <img src="img/RTL1.png" alt="RTL1" id="img1">
    <p>It indicates that if P=1, then the content of R1 is transferred to R2. It is a unidirectional operation.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Simultaneous Operations:</strong> If 2 or more operations are to occur simultaneously, then they are separated with a comma (,).</p>
    <img src="img/RTL2.png" alt="RTL2" id="img1">
    <p>If the control function P=1, then load the content of R1 into R2, and at the same clock, load the content of R2 into R1.</p>

		<strong>Addressing Modes Examples</strong>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Immediate Addressing:- </strong> Operand is directly specified in the instruction.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, 5 - Moves the immediate value 5 into register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Direct Addressing:-</strong> Operand is specified by a memory address directly in the instruction.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, [1000] - Moves the value stored at memory address 1000 into register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Indirect Addressing:-</strong> Operand address is held in a register or memory location, and the actual operand is located at that address.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, [BX] - Moves the value stored at the memory address stored in register BX into register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Register Addressing:-</strong> Operand is located in a register specified in the instruction.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> ADD AX, BX - Adds the value in register BX to the value in register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Indexed Addressing:-</strong> Operand address is calculated by adding an offset to a base address stored in a register.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, [SI+10] - Moves the value stored at the memory address obtained by adding 10 to the value in register SI into register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Relative Addressing:-</strong> Operand address is calculated relative to the current program counter or instruction pointer.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> JMP Label - Jumps to the instruction at the memory address specified by the label.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Base-Relative Addressing:-</strong> Similar to indexed addressing, but the base address is provided implicitly by a base register.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, [BP-4] - Moves the value stored at the memory address obtained by subtracting 4 from the value in register BP into register AX.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Stack Addressing:-</strong> Operands are accessed from the top of the stack, with stack pointers managing the stack's current position.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> PUSH AX - Pushes the value in register AX onto the stack.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Base Pointer Addressing:-</strong> Operands are accessed using a combination of a base register and a displacement specified in the instruction.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> MOV AX, [BX+2] - Moves the value stored at the memory address obtained by adding 2 to the value in register BX into register AX.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <strong>PC-relative Addressing:-</strong> Operand address is calculated relative to the current program counter.<br>
            
            <em>Example:</em> JMP Offset - Jumps to the instruction at the memory address specified by the offset relative to the current program counter.
        </li>
    </ol>
<strong>Fixed Point Number Representation</strong>
    <p>Fixed point format is derived directly from the decimal number representation. A number is represented as a sequence of digits separated by a radix point, where the digits to the left of the radix point represent the integer part and the digits to the right represent the fraction.</p>
    <p>Example: 37.65</p>
    <ul>
        <li>37 - integer part</li>
        <li>.</li>
        <li>65 - fractional part</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Signed Binary Number Representation</strong>
    <p>Represent -15 in the above representation using bit register:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inside magnitude:</li>
        <li>In 1s complement:</li>
        <li>In 2s complement:</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Floating Point Number Representation</strong>
    <p>F = IM × r^e</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>F - floating number</li>
        <li>IM - mantissa</li>
        <li>r - base</li>
        <li>e - exponent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Represent 1.23 in format using exponents 0, 1, and 2:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.23 × 10^0 or 1.23E+0</li>
        <li>0.123 × 10^1 or 0.123E+1</li>
        <li>0.0123 × 10^2 or 0.0123E+2</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Instruction Set</strong>
    <p>The instruction set in computer architecture is the set of machine-level instructions that a processor can execute.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Instructions:</strong> Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. (e.g., ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)</li>
        <li><strong>Logic Instructions:</strong> Perform logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.</li>

        <li><strong>Bit Manipulation Instructions:</strong> Perform operations at the bit level such as shifting and rotating. (e.g., SHIFT, ROTATE)</li>
    </ol>
