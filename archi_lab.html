<center><h4>To recognize various component</h4></center> 
Basic computer skills are essential for professionals in all roles and industries. A computer comprises two primary components, namely hardware and software. Knowing the role and utility of different 
computer components can help you improve your computer skills. In this article, we discuss the different components of a computer and share their purpose in the computer system.<br><br>
		
<b>What are the basic components of a computer?</b><br>
Here are the fundamental components of a computer along with their functions:<br><br>
		
<b>1. Central processing unit (CPU)-</b><br>
The CPU is the primary control centre of the computer, and it facilitates communication and collaboration between different hardware and software computer components. It is also usually the most complex and 
valuable part of the entire system because of its complicated design and utility. Without the CPU, the other parts of a computer serve no function. The power supply gives the CPU the necessary energy to process
different operations. CPUs require regular maintenance, like cleaning, dust removal, checking the fan and ensuring that all circuits are connected. The CPU contains the circuit boards, memory and RAM of a 
computer.<br><br>
		
<b>2. Motherboard-</b><br>
The motherboard acts as the central electrical circuit by connecting different parts, distributing power as per energy requirement and delivering information and instructions across the computer system.
The motherboard processes the actual exchange of information and data in a computer system and comprises the CPU, memory and secondary storage devices. Motherboards are very sensitive and may 
malfunction if exposed to high temperatures, pressure or humidity. They require maintenance to check for corrosion and electrical connections.<br><br>
		
<b>3. Random access memory (RAM)-</b><br>
RAM is the memory space that houses temporary data, processes, information and commands. When you launch a program or use an application, it uses the RAM to stay active and work optimally. Different types of 
computers may use different RAMs. The higher the RAM in your computer, the more is its processing power and ability to run various applications simultaneously. In many personal computers and laptops, people 
increase the RAM to complement an update in the operating system or other software. Deleting temporary files and turning off the computer regularly after usage help with efficient RAM utilisation.<br><br>
		
<b>4. Video graphics array port-</b><br>
A video graphic array (VGA) port is a connector usually present in desktops and other display devices. It is typically present on the side or back of a monitor or display screen and helps share the screen or 
visuals with another machine. Special VGA cables may be required to facilitate this sharing. You may also require the VGA port to connect a computer or laptop to a projector. The quality of visuals often depends
on the number of connectors in the port.
Newer video cards may not have a VGA output port, and smaller laptops may also omit them due to their compact design. In such a case, a signal converter may be necessary to connect them to a projector.<br><br>
<b>5. Power supply-</b><br>
The power supply port provides electricity that activates the entire computer system. Usually, the power chord is present at the back of the CPU or the PC tower and goes directly into the electricity socket. Places with variable power supplies may use a UPS or uninterrupted power supply unit to ensure that fluctuations do not impact the computer's performance. Many modern personal computers have in-built UPS units. Laptops operate on removable batteries that require charging periodically. The life cycle of laptop batteries is finite, and their performance decreases after a few years.<br><br>
<b>6. Cooling fan-</b><br>
A computer system or laptop uses electricity to operate and produces heat in the process. All CPUs and laptops have a cooling fan to circulate air in the internal system and prevent overheating. High-end computers may also have more than one cooling fan to ensure that the user can use heavy-duty applications that require high performance from the system. Usually, gaming computers and computers for professional purposes, like video editing and sound mixing, have more than one cooling fan. If your computer is frequently overheating, make sure you check the fan and clean it to remove any debris.<br><br>
<b>7. Hard drive-</b><br>
Hard drives are the storage devices that save the file, information and programs. They are usually magnetically coated discs that store all this data digitally. Hard drives with high storage can naturally save more data. You can also purchase external removable storage devices to manage data more efficiently. Alternatively, you can also move your data to cloud-based storage services and save storage memory on your system. Hard drives are susceptible to failure, and backing up your drives regularly is a good practice.<br><br>
<b>8. Display monitor-</b><br>
The display monitor of a computer is the screen where you can view different programs and operate the system. The resolution and pixel density of a monitor determines its sharpness and quality. The performance of a monitor is usually a top priority for all computer and laptop users. Laptop and computer screens emit artificial light that can be detrimental to your eyes if exposed for long durations without any break. You can affix an anti-glare film on your monitor or wear glasses while using the computer to minimise the effect of this light.<br><br>
<b>9. Keyboard-</b><br> 
The computer keyword is an important piece of hardware used to input text, characters and other important commands. The keyboard contains keys for alphabets, numerals and symbols, alongside having special keys for specific purposes and commands. In many tablets and virtual PCs, the keyboard may also be virtual. Different types of keyboards are available in the market, but most of them have the same set and arrangement of keys. A keyboard can be wireless or wired. Most keyboards also have a backlight to illuminate the keys and enable users to use the computer at night or in low-light conditions.<br><br>
<b>10. Printer-</b><br>
The printer generates a copy of virtual text or images on paper using ink. For example, if you make a text-based report on your computer, you can print several copies of this document. Inkjet and laser printers are the two most commonly used printers. Most leading computer companies also offer printers. Printers require maintenance, which includes regularly replacing ink cartridges and toner, removing jammed papers and cleaning connectors. 3D printers are also available, and you can produce 3D objects using the right code and raw materials.<br><br>
<b>11. Computer mouse-</b><br>
The mouse in a computer is a small device that controls the cursor and gives input to the system. A mouse can be wired or wireless, has left and right click-buttons and usually has a small scrolling wheel to help users navigate a long page. Mouses come in different shapes and sizes and can also be suitable for left or right-handed individuals. They usually require a flat surface to work optimally. Smaller-sized mouse devices are also available for users who want to travel with their computers or laptops.<br><br>
<b>12. System software-</b><br>
A computer has three crucial system software components. These software solutions act as an interface between the hardware and other applications and enable you to use the computer easily. These three crucial system software applications are:
<ol>		
<li>Operating system: the foundational software that runs the entire computer, its programs and applications</li>
<li>Language processor: the software that converts all user instructions into a language that the computer can understand</li>
<li>Device drivers: device-specific software that enables different devices, like a printer or mouse, to function<br><br></li></ol>
		
<b>13. Application software-</b><br>
These are individual software applications that provide specific functions and features. These applications are usually third-party services and can be based on the computer system and stored in the memory or have a cloud-based operation. Without application software, a computer system would have very little utility. Some popular examples include word processing software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, database management software, editing software and other multimedia software.<br><br>
<b>14. Utility software-</b><br>
These are optional but important software components of a computer that help improve its performance, security or utility. These software solutions help manage the computer's memory, files and other applications. They also help customise the interface and desktop, alongside making the computer system safer to use and helping with the recovery process in case of a system failure. Some common examples of utility software applications are anti-virus software, disk management tools, file management software, backup and encryption tools, compression software, disk defragmenter and disk cleaner software.<br><br>

<b>8086 Pin Diagram</b><br>		
Here is the pin diagram of 8086 microprocessor −<br>
<img src="img/pin_dig.png" alt="pin_dig" width="300px"><br>
Let us now discuss the signals in detail −<br>
<b>Power supply and frequency signals</b><br>
It uses 5V DC supply at VCC pin 40, and uses ground at VSS pin 1 and 20 for its operation.<br>
<b>Clock signal</b><br>
Clock signal is provided through Pin-19. It provides timing to the processor for operations. Its frequency is different for different versions, i.e. 5MHz, 8MHz and 10MHz.<br>
<b>Address/data bus</b><br>
AD0-AD15. These are 16 address/data bus. AD0-AD7 carries low order byte data and AD8AD15 carries higher order byte data. During the first clock cycle, it carries 16-bit address and after that it carries 16-bit data.<br>
<b>Address/status bus</b><br>
A16-A19/S3-S6. These are the 4 address/status buses. During the first clock cycle, it carries 4-bit address and later it carries status signals.</b><br>
<b>S7/BHE</b><br>
BHE stands for Bus High Enable. It is available at pin 34 and used to indicate the transfer of data using data bus D8-D15. This signal is low during the first clock cycle, thereafter it is active.</b><br>
<b>$\overline{RD}$</b><br>
It is available at pin 32 and is used to read signal for Read operation.<br>
<b>Ready</b><br>
It is available at pin 22. It is an acknowledgement signal from I/O devices that data is transferred. It is an active high signal. When it is high, it indicates that the device is ready to transfer data. When it is low, it indicates wait state.<br>
<b>RESET</b><br>
It is available at pin 21 and is used to restart the execution. It causes the processor to immediately terminate its present activity. This signal is active high for the first 4 clock cycles to RESET the microprocessor.<br>
<b>INTR</b><br>
It is available at pin 18. It is an interrupt request signal, which is sampled during the last clock cycle of each instruction to determine if the processor considered this as an interrupt or not.<br>
<b>NMI</b><br>
It stands for non-maskable interrupt and is available at pin 17. It is an edge triggered input, which causes an interrupt request to the microprocessor.<br>
$\overline{TEST}$<br><br>
This signal is like wait state and is available at pin 23. When this signal is high, then the processor has to wait for IDLE state, else the execution continues.<br>
<b>MN/$\overline{MX}$</b><br>
It stands for Minimum/Maximum and is available at pin 33. It indicates what mode the processor is to operate in; when it is high, it works in the minimum mode and vice-aversa.<br>
<b>INTA</b><br>
It is an interrupt acknowledgement signal and id available at pin 24. When the microprocessor receives this signal, it acknowledges the interrupt.<br>
<b>ALE</b><br>
It stands for address enable latch and is available at pin 25. A positive pulse is generated each time the processor begins any operation. This signal indicates the availability of a valid address on the address/data lines.<br>
<b>DEN</b><br>
It stands for Data Enable and is available at pin 26. It is used to enable Transreceiver 8286. The transreceiver is a device used to separate data from the address/data bus.<br>
<b>DT/R</b><br>
It stands for Data Transmit/Receive signal and is available at pin 27. It decides the direction of data flow through the transreceiver. When it is high, data is transmitted out and vice-a-versa.<br>
<b>M/IO</b><br>
This signal is used to distinguish between memory and I/O operations. When it is high, it indicates I/O operation and when it is low indicates the memory operation. It is available at pin 28.<br>
<b>WR</b><br>
It stands for write signal and is available at pin 29. It is used to write the data into the memory or the output device depending on the status of M/IO signal.<br>
<b>HLDA</b><br>
It stands for Hold Acknowledgement signal and is available at pin 30. This signal acknowledges the HOLD signal.<br>
<b>HOLD</b><br>
This signal indicates to the processor that external devices are requesting to access the address/data buses. It is available at pin 31.<br>
<b>QS1 and QS0</b><br>
These are queue status signals and are available at pin 24 and 25. These signals provide the status of instruction queue. Their conditions are shown in the following table-<br><br>

When a computer system is turned on it requires a series of initialization and test before the user can work on it. This process is called booting.<br><br>
<b>Basic Input Output System (BIOS) :</b><br>
It provides a set of instructions and is responsible for booting the computer. The BIOS performs all the test needed at startup time. These tests are collectively known as Power On Self Test(POST) .The computer contains hardware like keyboard, monitor, disk drives, etc. there functioning requires interfacing with the operating system. The BIOS provides drivers for basic hardware like keyboard and monitor, mouse, etc. The operating system provides hardware for printer, modem, etc. Drivers for some hardware may not be available in the operating system hence these have to be explicitly installed by the user.<br>
<b>Power On Self Test (POST) :</b><br>
POST consists of a series of diagnostic test that runs automatically when a user turns on the computer. The actual test may differ depending on the configuration of the BIOS. However, the usual test includes testing of the RAM, keyboard and the disk drives. If these tests are successful the computer boots itself and loads the operating system but if these tests are unsuccessful, the computer reports the errors through a series of beeps to draw the operator’s attention and finally an error message is displayed on the monitor.<br>
<img src="img/Table_dig.jpg" width="200px"><br><br>
<b>Location Of BIOS :</b><br>
BIOS is typically placed in a chip known as Read Only Memory(ROM) that comes with the computer. This ensures that the BIOS will always be available even if the hard disk is formatted or replaced. However, in many cases the content of the ROM is transferred to the RAM when the system is started. This is because the RAM allows quicker access as compared to the ROM. Copying of the content of the ROM to the RAM is known as shadowing.<br>
<b>Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor RAM :</b><br>
As the BIOS will interface the hardware with the operating system, it will require configurations of the hardware components like hard disk, monitor, etc. This information is permanently saved in an area known as Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Random Access Memory (CMOS RAM). Power is supplied to the CMOS from a small battery so its contents will not be lost after the PC is turned off. Therefore, there is a battery and a small RAM memory on the board which stores information in a permanent manner. The CMOS needs very little power so there is not much of strain on the computer’s battery. Even then the battery is rechargeable is recharged every time the computer is turned on.

<centre><h1>To study Motherboard</h1></centre>
 <b> Aim:-To study motherboard.</b><br>
  <b>Motherboard:</b> The main circuit board of a microcomputer. The motherboard contains the connectors for attaching additiona l boards. Typically, the motherboard contains the CPU, BIOS, memory, mass storage interfaces, serial and parallel ports, expansion slots, and all the controllers
  required to control standard peripheral devices, such as the display screen, keyboard, and disk drive. Collectively, all these chips that re side on the motherboard are known as the motherboard's chipset.
  The motherboard is the primary component of th e entire system. In addition to hardware the motherboard also contains some software .The system ROM actually contains three small but very critical programs these are post, the BIOS and the setup program. This device provides,even the C.P.U is enabled to function. In addi tion to hardware the mo therboard also contain some software. The following is the picture of motherboard:<br><br>
  <img src="img/motherboard.png"id="img1"><br>
  <b>1. Mouse & keyboard:</b> Keyboard Connectors are two types basically. All PCs have a Key board port connected directly to the motherboard. The oldest, but still quite common type, is a special DIN, and most PCs until recently retained this style connector. The AT-style keyboard connector is quickly disappearing, being replaced by the smaller mini DIN PS/2-style keyboard
connector. You can use an AT-style keyboard with a PS/2-style socket (or the other way around)by using a converter. Although the AT connector is unique in PCs, the PS/2-style mini-DIN is also used in more modern PCs for the mouse. Fortunately, most PCs that use the mini-DIN for both the keyboard and mouse clearly mark each mini-DIN socket as to its correct use. Some
keyboards have a USB connection, but these are fairly rare compared to the PS/2 connection keyboards.<br><br>

<b>2. USB (Universal serial bus):</b> USB is the General-purpose connection for PC. You can find USB versions of many different devices, such as mice, keyboards, scanners, cameras, and even printers. A USB connector's distinctive rectangular shape makes it easily recognizable. USB has a number of features that makes it particularly popular on PCs. First, USB devices are hot swappable. You can insert or remove them without restarting your system.<br><br>

<b>3. Parallel port:</b> Most printers use a special connector called a parallel port. Parallel port carries data on more than one wire, as opposed to the serial port, which uses only one wire.
Parallel ports use a 25-pin female DB connector. Parallel ports are directly supported by the motherboard through a direct connection or through a dangle.<br><br>

<b>4. CPU Chip:</b> The central processing unit, also called the microprocessor performs all the calculations that take place inside a pc. CPUs come in Variety of shapes and sizes. Modern CPUs generate a lot of heat and thus require a cooling fan or heat sink. The cooling device (such as a cooling fan) is removable, although some CPU manufactures sell the CPU with a fan
permanently attached.<br><br>

<b>5. RAM slots:</b> Random-Access Memory (RAM) stores programs and data currently being used by the CPU. RAM is measured in units called bytes. RAM has been packaged in many different ways. The most current package is called a 168-pin DIMM (Dual Inline Memory module).<br>

<b>6. Floppy controller:</b> The floppy drive connects to the computer via a 34-pin ribbon cable, which in turn connects to the motherboard. A floppy controller is one that is used to control the floppy drive.<br><br>

<b>7. IDE controller:</b> Industry standards define two common types of hard drives: EIDE and SCSI. Majority of the PCs use EIDE drives. SCSI drives show up in high end PCs such as network servers or graphical workstations. The EIDE drive connects to the hard drive via a 2-inch-wide, 40-pin ribbon cable, which in turn connects to the motherboard. IDE controller is responsible for controlling the hard drive.<br><br>

<b>8. PCI slot:</b> Intel introduced the Peripheral component interconnect bus protocol. The PCI bus is used to connect I/O devices (such as NIC or RAID controllers) to the main logic of the computer. PCI bus has replaced the ISA bus.<br><br>

<b>9. ISA slot:</b>(Industry Standard Architecture) It is the standard architecture of the Expansion bus. Motherboard may contain some slots to connect ISA compatible cards. The memory address bus is to 32 bits .The bus speed is 8.33 MHZ and the bandwidth is 16 bits.<br><br>

<b>10. CMOS Battery:</b> To provide CMOS with the power when the computer is turned off all motherboards comes with a battery. These batteries mount on the motherboard in one of three ways: the obsolete external battery, the most common onboard battery, and built-in battery.<br><br>

<b>11. AGP slot:</b> If you have a modern motherboard, you will almost certainly notice a single connector that looks like a PCI slot, but is slightly shorter and usually brown. You also probably have a video card inserted into this slot. This is an Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) slot.<br><br>

<b>12. CPU slot:</b> To install the CPU, just slide it straight down into the slot. Special notches in the slot make it impossible to install them incorrectly. So remember if it does not go easily, it is probably not correct. Be sure to plug in the CPU fan's power.<br><br>

<b>13. Power supply plug in:</b> The Power supply, as its name implies, provides the necessary electrical power to make the pc operate. The power supply takes standard 110-V AC power and converts into +/-12-Volt, +/-5-Volt, and 3.3-Volt DC power.
The power supply connector has 20-pins, and the connector can go in only one direction.<br><br>

<b>What is a printer?</b><br>
A printer is a device that accepts text and graphic output from a computer and transfers the information to paper, usually to standard-size, 8.5" by 11" sheets of paper. Printers vary in size, speed, sophistication and cost. In general, more expensive printers are used for more frequent printing or high-resolution color printing.<br><br>
Personal computer printers can be distinguished as impact or non-impact printers. Early impact printers worked something like an automatic typewriter, with a key striking an inked impression on paper for each printed character. The dot matrix printer, an impact printer that strikes the paper a line at a time, was a popular low-cost option.<br><br>
The best-known non-impact printers are the inkjet printer and the laser printer. The inkjet sprays ink from an ink cartridge at very close range to the paper as it rolls by, while the laser printer uses a laser beam reflected from a mirror to attract ink (called toner) to selected paper areas as a sheet rolls over a drum.<br><br>
<b><center><h1>Different types of printer</h1></center></b>
There are many different printer manufacturers available today, including Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Lexmark, among many others. There are also several types of printers to choose from, which we'll explore below.<br><br>
•	Inkjet printers recreate a digital image by spraying ink onto paper. These are the most common type of personal printer.<br>
•	Laser printers are used to create high-quality prints by passing a laser beam at a high speed over a negatively charged drum to define an image. Color laser printers are more often found in professional settings.<br>
•	3D printers are a relatively new printer technology. 3D printing creates a physical object from a digital file. It works by adding layer upon layer of material until the print job is complete and the object is whole.<br>
•	Thermal printers produce an image on paper by passing paper with a thermochromic coating over a print head comprised of electrically heated elements and produces an image in the area where the heated coating turns black. A dye-sublimation printer is a form of thermal printing technology that uses heat to transfer dye onto materials.<br>
•	All-in-one printers are multifunction devices that combine printing with other technologies such as a copier, scanner and/or fax machine.<br>
•	LED printers are similar to laser printers but use a light-emitting diode array in the print head instead of a laser.<br>
•	Photo printers are similar to inkjet printers but are designed specifically to print high-quality photos, which require a lot of ink and special paper to ensure the ink doesn't smear.<br>

<b>Aim:- To study SMPS<b></b><br> 
<b>SMPS<b></b>
A Switched-mode power supply (also Switching-mode power supply, SMPS, or simply Switcher) is an electronic Power Supply Unit (PSU) that incorporates a switching regulator in order to provide the required output voltage. An SMPS is actually a power converter that transmits power from a source (e.g., a battery or the electrical power grid) to a load (e.g., a personal computer) with ideally no loss. The function of the converter is to provide a reliable output voltage often at a different level than the input voltage.<br>

Below A - input EMI filtering<br>
A - Bridge rectifier<br>
B - Input filter capacitors<br>
Between B and C - Primary side heat sink<br>
C - Transformer<br>
Between C and D - Secondary side heat sink<br>
D - Output filter coil<br>
E - Output filter capacitors<br>
The coil and large yellow capacitor below E are additional input filtering components that are mounted directly on the power input connector and are not part of the main circuit board.<br>

<b>Classification<b></b><br>
SMPS can be classified into four types according to the input and output waveforms:<br>
• AC in, DC out: rectifier, off-line converter input stage<br>
• DC in, DC out: voltage converter, or current converter, or DC to DC converter<br>
• AC in, AC out: frequency changer, cycloconverter, transformer<br>
• DC in, AC out: inverter<br>
<b>Applications:<b></b><br>
Switched-mode PSUs in domestic products such as personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from most mains supplies throughout the world, with rated frequencies from 50 Hz to 60 Hz and voltages from 100 V to 240 V (although a manual voltage range switch may be required). In practice they will operate from a much wider frequency range and often from a DC supply as well. In 2006, at an Intel Developers Forum, Google engineers proposed the use of a single 12 V supply inside PCs, due to the high efficiency of switch mode supplies directly on the PCB.<br>
