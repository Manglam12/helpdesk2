        <strong>Q: What is the role of the Control Unit (CU) in a microprocessor?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> The Control Unit (CU) is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operations of the CPU. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them by coordinating the actions of other components such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and registers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: Can you explain the function of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in a CPU?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations on data received from memory or registers. These operations include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT operations. The ALU is a fundamental component of the CPU responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is the purpose of the Program Counter (PC) in a CPU?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> The Program Counter (PC) is a register in the CPU that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. It keeps track of the sequence of instructions being executed by incrementing its value after each instruction is executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is cache memory, and why is it used in computer systems?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located inside or very close to the CPU. It is used to temporarily store frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the average time to access memory. By storing copies of frequently used data, cache memory helps improve the overall performance of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is the purpose of the Memory Management Unit (MMU) in a computer system?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is responsible for translating logical addresses generated by the CPU into physical addresses in main memory. It also handles memory protection and access control, ensuring that processes cannot access memory locations they are not authorized to access.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is the difference between RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory)?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> RAM is a volatile memory used to store data and program instructions that are actively being used by the CPU. It is fast but loses its contents when power is turned off. ROM, on the other hand, is a non-volatile memory that stores firmware or boot code required to start up the computer. Its contents are retained even when power is turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is pipelining in CPU architecture, and how does it improve performance?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> Pipelining is a CPU design technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution. Each stage of instruction execution is performed concurrently by different parts of the CPU. This overlapping of instruction execution improves CPU throughput and overall performance by allowing multiple instructions to be in various stages of execution simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: Can you explain the concept of RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> RISC architecture is a CPU design philosophy that emphasizes a simple instruction set with a small number of instructions that can be executed in a single clock cycle. RISC CPUs typically have a simpler and more streamlined instruction execution pipeline, which can lead to higher performance and efficiency for certain types of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What are interrupts, and how are they handled by a CPU?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> Interrupts are signals sent by external devices or internal CPU mechanisms to request immediate attention from the CPU. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU temporarily suspends its current execution and transfers control to an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to handle the interrupt. After the interrupt is serviced, the CPU resumes its previous execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Q: What is the role of the Memory Controller in a computer system?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> The Memory Controller is responsible for managing the flow of data between the CPU and main memory. It coordinates memory accesses, including read and write operations, and ensures data integrity and coherency. The Memory Controller plays a crucial role in optimizing memory performance and system reliability.
