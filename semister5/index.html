        <que>1. What is Software?</que><br>
        <ans>Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts, and programs that run on a device. <br>Software refers to a collection of data, programs, or instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks or operations. It enables hardware to function and execute desired processes, and it can include applications, operating systems, and utilities. Software is intangible, and it is essential for any hardware to be operational.        </ans><br>
        
        <que>2. What are different types of software?</que><br>
        <ans>Software can be broadly categorized into two types: system software and application software. <br>System software includes operating systems, device drivers, and utility programs that manage and support a computer's basic functions. <br>Application software refers to programs that perform specific tasks for users, such as word processors, spreadsheets, and database management systems.</ans><br>
        
        <que>3. Define software engineering.</que><br>
        <ans>Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves the use of methodologies, tools, and techniques to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate software systems to ensure they are reliable, efficient, and meet user requirements.</ans><br>
        
        <que>4. What is SDLC?</que><br>
        <ans>SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a process used by software engineers to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It consists of several phases: requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase has specific deliverables and tasks that need to be completed before moving on to the next phase.</ans><br>
        
        <que>5. What is an SRS document?</que><br>
        <ans>SRS, or Software Requirements Specification, is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and system interactions. The SRS document serves as a blueprint for the development team and a reference for stakeholders.</ans><br>
        
        <que>6. What is DFD?</que><br>
        <ans>DFD, or Data Flow Diagram, is a graphical representation of the flow of data through a system. It shows how data enters, is processed, and exits the system. DFDs are used to visualize data processing and help in understanding the system's functionality and the flow of information within it.</ans><br>
        
        <que>7. What is UML?</que><br>
        <ans>UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system. UML includes a set of graphical notation techniques to create abstract models of a system, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams.</ans><br>
        
        <que>8. Discuss about levels of testing.</que><br>
        <ans>There are several levels of software testing, including:
        
        <li>Unit Testing: Testing individual units or components of the software to ensure they work correctly.</li>
        <li>Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between integrated units or components to detect interface defects.</li>
        <li>System Testing: Testing the complete and integrated software system to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements.</li>
       <li> Acceptance Testing: Testing conducted to determine if the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment.</li>
        </ans><br>
        <que>9. What are the different types of maintenance?</que><br>
        <ans>Software maintenance is the process of modifying a software system after it has been delivered. The different types of maintenance include:
        
        <li>Corrective Maintenance: Fixing bugs and defects in the software.</li>
        <li>Adaptive Maintenance: Updating the software to work in a new or changed environment.</li>
        <li>Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing the software by adding new features or improving existing functionalities.</li>
        <li>Preventive Maintenance: Making changes to prevent potential future problems.</li>
        </ans><br>
