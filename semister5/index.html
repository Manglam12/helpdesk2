        <mark><que>10. what is White Board and Black Board testing?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>In software testing, White Box Testing and Black Box Testing are two distinct approaches used to validate software functionality: <br>
        <ol type="i">
          <li> White Box Testing:-</li>
           <ul type="disc">
            <li>Also known as Clear Box or Glass Box testing.</li>
            <li> The tester has knowledge of the internal structure, code, and logic of the software.</li>
            <li>Tests are designed based on the understanding of the code to verify the flow of inputs through the code, logic paths, and possible outputs.</li>
            <li> Focuses on code coverage, including paths, branches, and conditions.</li>
            <li> Example techniques: Unit Testing, Code Coverage Testing, Path Testing.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Black Box Testing:-</li>
          <ul type="disc">
          <li>The tester has no knowledge of the internal code or structure.</li>
          <li>Focuses on testing the software's functionality based on requirements and specifications.</li>
          <li>Inputs are given, and outputs are verified to ensure the system behaves as expected without considering how the software is implemented.</li>
          <li>Example techniques: Functional Testing, Acceptance Testing, System Testing.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol></ans> <br>

        <mark><que>11. When we use Classical model?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>The Classical Model (also known as the Waterfall Model) in software development is used when: <br>
          <li>Clear and Stable Requirements: The project requirements are well-understood, clearly defined, and unlikely to change over time.</li>
          <li>Linear Process: The project can be completed in a linear, sequential manner, where each phase depends on the completion of the previous one (e.g., requirements → design → implementation → testing → maintenance).</li>
          <li>Small or Medium-sized Projects: The project is relatively simple and small to medium in size, making a structured approach more feasible.</li>
          <li>No Immediate Feedback Needed: Since feedback loops are minimal or absent between phases, it works well when the client or stakeholders do not need to see regular progress updates or changes</li>
          <li>Low Complexity and Risks: The project has low technical complexity and minimal risk of unexpected changes or complications.</li>
          <li>Well-documented Development Process: Emphasis is placed on comprehensive documentation at each stage, making it suitable for environments that require clear audit trails.</li>
        </ans> <br>


        <mark><que>12.Describe Interactive Waterfall Model ?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>The Iterative Waterfall Model is a software development approach that combines the sequential steps of the traditional Waterfall Model with the flexibility of iterative design. It allows for improvements and changes to be made at each stage of the development process, instead of waiting until the end of the project. The iterative waterfall model provides feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases, which is the main difference from the classical waterfall model. <br> The Interactive Waterfall Model is a variation of the traditional Waterfall model where feedback and iterations are introduced between phases. In this model, instead of moving strictly in a linear, one-way process, some steps allow revisiting previous phases to refine or adjust work based on feedback or evolving understanding, while still maintaining the general sequential structure of the Waterfall approach.</ans> <br><br>


        <mark><que>13. Describe  evolutionary  model?</que><br></mark>
        <ans>This evolutionary model concept comes into the picture after the user faces the partially developed system rather than waiting for the fully developed version. The idea of this evolutionary model comes from developing the core module and then improving the software product by using iterative and incremental techniques with appropriate feedback.

          In this evolutionary process model, the software product is in the sensitive version, which is made through many iterations, and then the final product is prepared. This evolutionary approach also suggests breaking down all the models into maintainable smaller chunks. After that, we can prioritize all the smaller products. After completing all the products, we can deliver those chunks one at a time to the users.
          
          It plays a vital role in large projects where we can easily search the module for the implementation of incremental things. It is also an influential model because it collects customer feedback throughout the development process, and the customer can use the base feature of the project before the release of the entire working version.</ans> <br><br>


          <mark><que>14. When we use the SDLC model?</que><br></mark>
          <ans>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is used when there is a need for a structured, organized, and methodical approach to software development. It provides a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The SDLC model is typically employed in situations where a project requires clear stages and defined processes to ensure quality, consistency, and alignment with business objectives.

            Organizations use the SDLC model to manage complex software projects, as it helps break down the development process into distinct phases: requirements gathering, system design, implementation (coding), testing, deployment, and maintenance. This structured approach ensures that each phase is carefully planned and executed, reducing risks, avoiding missed requirements, and improving the quality of the final product.
            
            The SDLC model is particularly useful in projects where it's critical to have formalized processes, thorough documentation, and a predictable development timeline. It helps project managers, developers, and stakeholders understand the scope of the project, anticipate challenges, and manage resources efficiently.
            
            In highly regulated industries or large enterprise environments, the SDLC model provides the necessary framework for complying with regulatory requirements, maintaining audit trails, and ensuring that the software meets stringent quality standards.
            
            The model is used when there is a clear understanding of the project requirements from the beginning. It works well for projects with well-defined objectives and stable requirements, minimizing the need for major changes later in the development process. Even when changes are required, the SDLC model accommodates them through maintenance and continuous improvement phases.
            
            In summary, the SDLC model is used when a well-organized, structured, and predictable approach to software development is required, making it an essential framework for managing large-scale, complex software projects that demand reliability, precision, and consistency.</ans> <br> <br>
